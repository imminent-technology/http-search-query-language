These are the attributes to consider during the evaluation of a query language:

- **Expressiveness**: how the query language lets users express complex queries and retrieve information efficiently. It should support various data manipulation and retrieval operations, such as filtering, sorting, aggregating, and joining data.
- **Simplicity**: the query language should be intuitive and easy to understand, reducing the learning curve for users. A simple syntax and logical structure can improve developer productivity and make the language more accessible to a broader audience.
- **Flexibility**: the query language should be flexible enough to work with diverse data models and schema structures. It should support dynamic schema changes, allowing the addition or modification of fields without requiring extensive modifications to the existing queries or data structures.
- **Community and Ecosystem**: the size and activity of the user community, as well as the availability of resources, documentation, tutorials, and support. A robust ecosystem with active development, libraries, and tools can enhance the productivity and longevity of the query language.
- **Extensibility**: whether the query language allows for extensibility through user-defined functions or extensions. This enables customization and the ability to leverage domain-specific operations or optimize for specific use cases.
- **Orthogonality**: the degree to which the language features are independent and do not overlap or interact in unexpected ways. Orthogonality is a desirable attribute in a query language as it promotes clarity, simplicity, and flexibility in expressing queries and manipulating data.

Attributes of orthogonality in query languages:

- **Independence of features**: orthogonal query languages have features that can be used independently of each other. Each feature serves a distinct purpose and does not rely on or interfere with other features. For example, if a query language supports filtering and aggregation operations, these two features should not be tightly coupled, allowing users to apply them separately or in combination as needed.
- **Consistency in syntax**: an orthogonal query language maintains consistency in its syntax and semantics across different operations. This consistency allows users to learn and apply the language more easily since they can rely on common patterns and understand how each construct behaves consistently across various contexts.
- **Minimal redundancy**: an orthogonal query language avoids unnecessary redundancy or duplication of functionality. Redundancy can lead to confusion and make the language more complex. By eliminating redundant features, the language remains concise and straightforward.
- **Non-interference**: orthogonal query languages ensure that different features or constructs do not interfere with each other. This means that applying one feature should not unintentionally affect or alter the behavior of another feature. Users can rely on the behavior of each feature independently without unexpected side effects.
- **Composability**: orthogonal query languages support the composition of language constructs in a meaningful and predictable manner. Users can combine different language features, such as filtering, sorting, and grouping, in a flexible way to express complex queries. The composability of the language enables users to build expressive and efficient queries by combining independent building blocks.
